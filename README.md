## My process

This was a really interesting Challenge especially because of the JS part. Just like other challenges, i chose mobile first approach ðŸ“±. 

For the first time I faced some HTML challenges (choosing between form fields or just regular para/heading) but bigger than that was the JS part. The challenge for me was how to read values from the fields after user inputs the proper value (and not NaN). But I figured it out by using the "change" event listener on all input fields.ðŸ¤”

I also tried to make the page more accessible (ðŸ¤ž)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

- Learnt about more [Event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) & [Pesudo Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) (shoutout to MDN Docs for providing such great documentation ðŸ¤©)
- âœ… Learnt to declare all functions at top of Script


```html
<!-- I liked the forms in this one -->
<input class="input-field" type="number" name="number-people" id="people-count" placeholder="0" aria-label="enter-number-of-people" required aria-required="The number of people cannot be 0" min="0" max="100" />
```

## Acknowledgments

I referred to [ellienndea's](https://github.com/ellienndea/tip-calculator-app) solution to understand her approach on making buttons clickable (like checkboxes) and how the calculator needs to function. Her approach is really good one, and she also essentially used form inputs, which inspired me to do the same (as I thought it would be more accessible too ðŸ˜Š)
